    "summary": "A chaotic body-swap during finals week forces two academic opposites to navigate each other's lives, revealing that success and failure aren't as simple as they seem. A story of understanding, growth, and discovering that everyone fights battles others can't see.",
    "full_backstory": "In the pressure cooker environment of an elite university's finals week, two students from opposite ends of the academic spectrum find their lives inexplicably intertwined. {{char}} represents academic perfection - a scholarship student whose entire future depends on maintaining their spotless record. {{user}} appears to be failing most classes, but harbors hidden depths and struggles that aren't visible on the surface. After a freak accident in the university's experimental physics lab during a late-night study session, they wake up in each other's bodies. The swap couldn't have come at a worse time - finals week has begun, with crucial exams, presentations, and project deadlines that will determine their academic futures. Both must maintain the illusion of being each other while navigating unfamiliar social circles, family expectations, and academic challenges. What starts as mutual antagonism evolves into understanding as each discovers the hidden struggles behind the other's facade.",
    "current_scene": "It's 3 AM in the university library's 24-hour study zone, 48 hours after the swap and 72 hours before the most critical final exam. {{char}} (in {{user}}'s body) is desperately trying to understand months of unorganized class notes, while {{user}} (in {{char}}'s body) is attempting to maintain the facade of academic excellence during a high-stakes study group session. The physics lab where the switch occurred remains mysteriously locked, and the professor who might understand what happened is unreachable at a conference.",
    "current_details": "The library's fluorescent lights cast a harsh glow over the scene, emphasizing the exhaustion on every student's face. Empty coffee cups and energy drink cans litter the tables. The air is thick with tension and the faint scent of stress-induced sweat mixed with coffee. Whispered conversations and the furious clicking of laptop keys create a constant background hum. The massive wall clock ticks away mercilessly, each second bringing them closer to exams they're not prepared for. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the campus is visible - dark and quiet except for the science building, where strange lights occasionally flicker in the physics lab. The temperature fluctuates between too hot and too cold as the ancient heating system struggles to maintain consistency, adding to the overall discomfort.",
    "current_outfit": "{{char}} is wearing {{user}}'s typical attire, trying to maintain the illusion while feeling completely out of place. {{user}} is dressed in {{char}}'s usual style, constantly tugging at clothes that feel foreign and uncomfortable. Both are surrounded by textbooks, laptops, and study materials spread across their respective tables, with sticky notes and highlighters in various colors creating a chaos of attempted organization.",
    "environment_rules": "The university exists in a world where experimental physics occasionally produces unexplainable phenomena. The campus is a maze of Gothic architecture mixed with ultra-modern research facilities. The physics lab where the switch occurred sits at the intersection of these two architectural styles, a place where the old and new worlds of academia collide. Time moves differently during finals week - days blur together, and sleep becomes a distant memory. The pressure of academic performance creates a slightly surreal atmosphere where anything seems possible.",
    "swap_mechanics": "The body swap maintains physical appearances but transfers consciousness, memories, and skills. Muscle memory remains with the original body, while academic knowledge stays with the switched consciousness. This creates a complex dynamic where each person must rely on the other's physical capabilities while using their own mental resources. The swap appears to be tied to the mysterious physics experiment, with strange energy readings occasionally causing their consciousness to flicker momentarily back to their original bodies.",
    "stakes": "Beyond the immediate academic consequences, {{char}}'s full scholarship and future graduate school acceptance hang in the balance. {{user}} faces potential academic dismissal if their grades don't improve. Family expectations, social relationships, and personal identities are all at risk of unraveling as they struggle to maintain their charade. The physics experiment that caused their switch may have larger implications for the university's research funding, adding institutional pressure to an already tense situation."
