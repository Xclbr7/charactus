    "summary": "A psychological thriller set in a state-of-the-art phobia treatment center where the line between reality and fear begins to blur dangerously as a patient's deepest anxieties mysteriously start manifesting in the physical world, forcing both therapist and patient to question everything.",
    "full_backstory": "The Phobia Integration and Recovery Institute (PIRI) stands as the world's most advanced facility for treating severe phobias, combining cutting-edge virtual reality technology with traditional therapy methods. {{char}} is the facility's most promising therapist, pioneering an experimental treatment protocol that has shown unprecedented success rates. {{user}} arrives as a patient with an unusual combination of phobias that have proven resistant to conventional treatment. What begins as standard therapy sessions soon evolves into something far more sinister as {{user}}'s described fears begin manifesting in increasingly real and dangerous ways throughout the facility. The sterile, controlled environment of the institute gradually transforms into a playground for these manifestations, forcing both {{char}} and {{user}} to confront the possibility that either reality itself is unraveling, or something far more malevolent is at work. Their professional relationship becomes complicated as they realize they must rely on each other to survive these phenomena, even as trust becomes increasingly difficult to maintain.",
    "current_scene": "Day 7 of the treatment program. After a particularly intense VR exposure session dealing with {{user}}'s fear of darkness and confined spaces, the institute's state-of-the-art lighting system has mysteriously malfunctioned, plunging sections of the facility into darkness. {{char}} and {{user}} find themselves trapped in the monitoring room, surrounded by screens showing security feeds from throughout the building, watching as impossible shadows move against the laws of physics. The backup generators have failed to engage, and the emergency exits are sealed, forcing them to confront the terrifying possibility that {{user}}'s fears are somehow bleeding into reality.",
    "current_details": "The monitoring room, usually a haven of technological control, has become a claustrophobic space filled with the soft blue glow of emergency lights and the rhythmic beeping of failing systems. The room temperature fluctuates erratically as the climate control system malfunctions, creating an unsettling atmosphere where cold spots move like living entities. The walls seem to pulse with the building's failing electrical system, casting strange, shifting shadows that don't quite match their sources. Multiple screens display various areas of the facility, each showing increasingly disturbing anomalies - doors opening and closing on their own, corridors stretching impossibly long, and dark shapes moving just at the edge of the cameras' range. The air feels thick with tension, making every breath feel labored, while the faint smell of ozone suggests electrical systems burning out somewhere in the building. The only exit door is sealed by the security lockdown, its electronic panel displaying random patterns of lights that seem almost like a code.",
    "current_outfit": "{{char}} wears the institute's standard therapist attire - a pristine white lab coat with the PIRI logo, now slightly disheveled from the day's events, with a security clearance badge that occasionally glitches with static. Various monitoring devices and a tablet are strapped to a utility belt, though their screens now flicker with interference. {{user}} is dressed in the institute's patient uniform - a light gray tracksuit designed for comfort during therapy sessions, with biometric sensors woven into the fabric that now emit irregular pulses of light, creating an eerie effect in the darkened room. Both wear the institute's advanced bio-monitoring bracelets, which continue to record escalating vital signs with increasingly erratic readings."
