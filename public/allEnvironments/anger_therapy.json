    "summary": "A tense psychological journey where boundaries blur between healer and patient in a high-stakes therapeutic relationship set against the backdrop of an elite psychiatric practice in Manhattan's Upper East Side",
    "full_backstory": "The therapeutic relationship unfolds in an ultra-modern psychiatric practice on the 45th floor of a gleaming Manhattan skyscraper, where floor-to-ceiling windows offer panoramic views of Central Park. The practice is renowned for treating high-profile clients using cutting-edge therapeutic techniques combined with AI-assisted analysis. The stakes are high as this particular case could either validate or destroy the controversial new treatment protocol being developed. Their sessions, initially following standard procedure, begin evolving into complex psychological chess matches where power dynamics shift unpredictably. The therapeutic boundaries become increasingly blurred as their sessions reveal parallel struggles with control, vulnerability, and the weight of professional reputations. The tension builds with each session as they navigate through layers of resistance, transference, and the dangerous territory where professional ethics meet human connection.",
    "current_scene": "Session 17 of a planned 24-session treatment protocol. The previous session ended abruptly after an intense breakthrough moment triggered an unexpected emotional response. Now, ten minutes into today's session, the atmosphere is charged with unresolved tension from the previous week. The city below is being pelted by a thunderstorm, its dramatic flashes occasionally illuminating the office space, adding to the charged atmosphere.",
    "current_details": "The office is a masterpiece of modern therapeutic design - warm walnut panels contrast with cool steel and glass, creating an environment that balances professionalism with comfort. A state-of-the-art AI system silently monitors vocal patterns, micro-expressions, and physiological responses through discreet sensors embedded in the furniture. The customized aromatherapy system diffuses calming lavender and sage. Two ergonomic chairs face each other at a carefully calculated angle of 100 degrees - close enough for connection but positioned to allow comfortable eye contact or avoidance. A white noise machine hums softly, ensuring complete privacy. The storm outside creates dramatic shadows that dance across the textured wallpaper. The room temperature is maintained at a precise 71.5 degrees Fahrenheit, though the emotional temperature in the room feels much higher. A tablet on the side table displays real-time biometric data, its screen occasionally flickering with updates. The air is thick with unspoken words and professional boundaries being tested.",
    "current_outfit": "The office dress code reflects the practice's blend of approachability and authority. The therapeutic space requires careful attention to nonverbal cues, where every detail of presentation carries psychological weight. The clothing choices serve as both armor and expression, each element carefully selected to either maintain or challenge the traditional power dynamics of the therapeutic relationship. The subtle details of fabric, fit, and style speak volumes in this environment where everything is subject to analysis.",
