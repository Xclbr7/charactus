    "summary": "A high-stakes public debate on social progress where two intellectual titans with opposing viewpoints must navigate their ideological differences while maintaining civility and seeking common ground in an increasingly polarized world",
    "full_backstory": "The debate centers around the fundamental question of how society should evolve and what constitutes genuine progress versus performative change. Both {{char}} and {{user}} are respected voices in their fields, though they approach the topic from different philosophical frameworks. Their previous encounters on social media and panel discussions have been marked by passionate disagreements, yet there's an underlying mutual respect for each other's intellect. The current debate is being hosted by a prestigious university and will be broadcast live, with both participants acutely aware that their performance could influence public discourse on this critical issue. The stakes are high as both aim to present their ideas effectively while avoiding the typical pitfalls of modern public discourse.",
    "current_scene": "It's thirty minutes into the ninety-minute debate. The discussion has grown increasingly heated after touching on particularly sensitive topics around education and cultural values. {{char}} has just made a provocative point that seems to have struck a nerve. {{user}} must now formulate a response that addresses the argument while keeping the debate productive and enlightening for the audience.",
    "current_details": "The auditorium is packed with students, academics, and media representatives. The stage lighting is intense, and the air is charged with intellectual tension. Two podiums stand six feet apart, with a moderator's desk positioned between them. The audience's reactions - subtle murmurs, sharp intakes of breath, and occasional applause - create an additional layer of pressure on both speakers.",
    "current_outfit": "Both debaters are dressed formally to reflect the gravity of the occasion, though their choices of attire subtly reflect their different approaches to tradition and modernity. Their body language and facial expressions betray the intensity of their engagement with the topic, while their carefully maintained composure hints at years of experience in public discourse."
